1.20 - Fixed: Sudden stopping of spawning. This was caused by accidentally not deleting all groups. (A3 has a group limit of 145)
	   The script now uses allPlayers instead of constantly updating an array
       Removed CBA_fnc_randPos, the script now uses a more lightweight, self-written routine. Cars should spawn _much_ faster now
	   Completely reworked script structure

1.15 - Added: Debug options (L_civs_debug = 1, 2 or 3);
	   Fixed: Cars won't automatically despawn if their owner dies and players are nearby
	   Fixed: Cars and civilians will only despawn if no players are nearby
	   Fixed: Never ending loop in a function
	   Fixed: There should be no cars that are just standing around anymore
	   Fixed: Improved the waypoint search routine
	   Fixed: Civilians sometimes wouldn't spawn after all players were within blacklisted markers
	   Fixed: Some slight code and performance improvements
	   Fixed: Road detection
	   Fixed: Built in some safety mechanisms, never ending (unwanted) loops should be gone forever
